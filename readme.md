## Twitter API Dashboard

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Project Goal was to create fully functional interface for Twitter API. Flask App allows user to find out what is currently trending and extract data sample to MongoDB.
Once data sample is extracted, next step is to pre-process it and load to SQL database. Final step is to apply Keras LSTM model on processed tweets to find out what's the dominating sentiment 
among conversation participants - positive, negative or neutral.
